Once upon a time there was a mouse named Michael and there was a Dog named Butch.
They both lived in a two story house with a family of seven. Michael lived in the basement
all by himself. Michael was a lonely mouse. He couldn't talk to anyone. The little mouse
often went up stairs to go see what was going on. Butch was a huge bull Dog, but he was a
friendly dog to everyone. He was light brown with a short tail. One night as the Simpson
family was watching movies, Butch decided to go down to the basement and check it out.
When he got down there, he sniffed around the little mouse on the old couch. Michael
watched as Butch sniffed around his humble home. Butch finally noticed Michael shaking in
one corner of couch. Butch slowly moved up to him.
Butch looked curiously at Michael. He asked, "Who are you?"
Michael mouth was wide open. He was shocked to hear this creature talking to him. Michael
said in a shaky voice? "My name is Michael."
Butch looked at Michael and told him "Don't be afraid." Butch started talking to Michael
about where he came from and the places he has been. Michael felt at ease as Butch started
talking to him about his life.
Weeks past by as Michael and Butch got to know each other. Both Michael and Butch
started hanging out at Michael place, in the basement. From there they became friends,
after so many years of being alone. Michael's prayers were answered. He was very happy
he found a friend to talk to.
