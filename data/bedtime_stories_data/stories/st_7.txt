Once upon a time there was an angel name Samantha. She was always getting into trouble.
Samantha would make up stories and she was always getting into a lot of hot water. Some
of the other angels noticed this. They started talking about how they should deal with this.
One angel said, "Maybe we could teach her a lesson." They all agreed. The next day they
called Sam into the cloud room. The boss of all the angels asked Sam to go down to earth
and help someone in need.
Sam said, "OK."
"But there is one thing you must remember," the boss angel said, "You will not have any
powers." Sam did not think this was fair. The big boss gave Sam a very nasty look and he
ordered her "Go!"
Down to earth she went. She had to find someone in need of help. Samantha looked and
looked all over the place.
On one street corner she spotted two kids and a small dog. Sam came up to them and
asked how they were doing; they said they were fine. Sam asked if they needed any help.
One child looked at her very strangely and said no. She moved on.
Next she saw two animals wondering around. "They look lost." She said to herself. She went
up to them and they began to bark at her. Sam became very scared and upset. She did not
know what to do. She calmed herself down and started to talk to them. When they heard
her voice they stopped barking at her. The angel felt very happy and so she helped the little
dogs find their way home.
Samantha was thinking to herself, "If I could help instead of being bad all the time then I
would feel good about what I have done."
When the little angel got home the boss asked her if she had learned a lesson. Sam told him
that she had. The big boss was very pleased.
When Sam left the room, all the little angels asked her if she was all right. Sam said yes.
Everyone was happy. Then, Sam and the other angels said their prayers and went to sleep.
