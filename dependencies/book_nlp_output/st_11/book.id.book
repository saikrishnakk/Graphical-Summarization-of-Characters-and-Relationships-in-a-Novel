he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but _ he _ had never seen anything but affability in her . She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself -- some shelves in the closet up stairs .

'' ","i":24697},{"w":"`` I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . It amazes me , I confess ; for , certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . But I will no longer importune my young cousin . '' ","i":24786},{"w":"`` As to her _ younger _ daughters , she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _ know _ of any prepossession ; her _ eldest _ daughter , she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . '' ","i":25364},{"w":"`` I know very well , madam , '' ","i":30265},{"w":"`` that when persons sit down to a card-table , they must take their chances of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . '' ","i":30277},{"w":"`` I have found out , '' ","i":35572},{"w":"`` by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! Who would have thought of my meeting with , perhaps , a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . '' ","i":35582},{"w":"`` I have no reason , I assure you , '' ","i":36247},{"w":"`` to be dissatisfied with my reception . Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . It was really a very handsome thought . Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . '' ","i":36261},{"w":"`` If I , '' ","i":37387},{"w":"`` were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . '' ","i":37396},{"w":"`` Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you , that I have your respected mother 's permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house , I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . '' ","i":38892},{"w":"`` My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances -LRB- like myself -RRB- to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion -LRB- unasked too ! -RRB- on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh 's footstool , that she said , ` Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake ; and for your _ own _ , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I can assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father -LRB- who , however , may live many years longer -RRB- , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents , which will not be yours till after your mother 's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . '' ","i":39107},{"w":"`` I am not now to learn , '' ","i":39764},{"w":"`` that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second , or even a third time . I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . '' ","i":39785},{"w":"`` Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , '' ","i":39985},{"w":"`` but I can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again , I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualification . '' ","i":40003},{"w":"`` When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . '' ","i":40186},{"w":"`` Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , '' ","i":40993},{"w":"`` but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . '' ","i":41007},{"w":"`` My dear madam , '' ","i":42448},{"w":"`` let us be for ever silent on this point . Far be it from me , '' ","i":42457},{"w":"`` to resent the behaviour of your daughter . Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own . But we are all liable to error . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise .

She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us . I _ should _ say , one of her ladyship 's carriages , for she has several . '' ","i":58079},{"w":"`` She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well .

I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there -LRB- an invitation , moreover , including the whole party -RRB- so immediately after your arrival ! '' ","i":58962},{"w":"`` I know not , Miss Elizabeth , '' ","i":78708},{"w":"`` whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .

Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine 's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings .

There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately , one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte 's marriage . It is unaccountable ! In every view it is unaccountable ! '' ","i":49636},{"w":"`` I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley 's conduct to design , '' ","i":50241},{"w":"`` but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people 's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . '' ","i":50261},{"w":"`` An excellent consolation in its way , '' ","i":51846},{"w":"`` but it will not do for _ us _ . We do not suffer by _ accident _ . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before .

It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us ? Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . '' ","i":52066},{"w":"`` She will drop the acquaintance entirely . '' ","i":52399},{"w":"`` You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . I have nothing to say against _ him _ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . But as it is , you must not let your fancy run away with you . You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . Your father would depend on _ your _ resolution and good conduct , I am sure . You must not disappoint your father . '' ","i":52977},{"w":"`` As I did the other day , '' ","i":53503},{"w":"`` very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _ that _ . But do not imagine that he is always here so often . It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . You know my mother 's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be the wisest ; and now I hope you are satisfied . '' ","i":53519},{"w":"`` I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . '' ","i":53845},{"w":"`` but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore , my last letter had never reached her . I inquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall see them soon here . '' ","i":54336},{"w":"`` My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley 's regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy -- your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there . -- Yours , etc. '' ","i":54576},{"w":"`` But my dear Elizabeth , '' ","i":56479},{"w":"`` what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . '' ","i":56489},{"w":"`` Well , '' ","i":56786},{"w":"`` have it as you choose . _ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . '' ","i":56793},{"w":"`` And is this all ? '' ","i":58562},{"w":"`` I like her appearance , '' ","i":58714},{"w":"`` Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . '' ","i":59170},{"w":"`` No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education .

They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I will not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman 's of superior execution . '' ","i":64537},{"w":"`` I should never have considered the distance as one of the _ advantages _ of the match , '' ","i":65644},{"w":"`` I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . But that is not the case _ here _ . Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _ near _ her family under less than _ half _ the present distance . '' ","i":65747},{"w":"`` My dear , Eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called us in this familiar way .

I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . '' ","i":67521},{"w":"`` Oh ! yes , '' ","i":67817},{"w":"`` Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .

'' ","i":68276},{"w":"`` In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could _ feel _ gratitude , I would now thank you . But I can not -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . '' ","i":69674},{"w":"`` I might as well inquire , '' ","i":69955},{"w":"`` why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _ was _ uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my feelings decided against you -- had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?

'' ","i":81961},{"w":"`` Indeed , '' ","i":81981},{"w":"`` I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings , which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? '' ","i":81988},{"w":"`` But you _ will _ know it , when I tell you what happened the very next day . '' ","i":82067},{"w":"`` This will not do , '' ","i":82191},{"w":"`` you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Darcy 's ; but you shall do as you choose . '' ","i":82201},{"w":"`` Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham 's character . '' ","i":82728},{"w":"`` Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your opinion ? '' ","i":82797},{"w":"`` You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character . We must not make him desperate . '' ","i":82973},{"w":"`` Oh well ! it is just as he chooses . Nobody wants him to come . Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart ; and then he will be sorry for what he has done . '' ","i":83477},{"w":"`` If you were aware , '' ","i":84589},{"w":"`` of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner -- nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . '' ","i":84599},{"w":"`` Oh , no ! '' ","i":85968},{"w":"`` In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . '' ","i":85977},{"w":"`` When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement , but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . '' ","i":86039},{"w":"`` But surely , '' ","i":87846},{"w":"`` I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . '' ","i":87854},{"w":"`` And of this place , '' ","i":89149},{"w":"`` I might have been mistress ! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , '' ","i":89159},{"w":"`` Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? '' ","i":89571},{"w":"`` A little . '' ","i":89587},{"w":"`` I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . This room was my late master 's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . He was very fond of them . '' ","i":89614},{"w":"`` Except , '' ","i":89869},{"w":"`` when she goes to Ramsgate . '' ","i":89876},{"w":"`` It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . '' ","i":89940},{"w":"`` I say no more than the truth , and everybody will say that knows him , '' ","i":89960},{"w":"`` Yes , sir , I know I am . If I were to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . But I have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted boy in the world . '' ","i":90103},{"w":"`` Can this be Mr. Darcy ? '' ","i":90172},{"w":"`` Yes , ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . '' ","i":90196},{"w":"`` In what an amiable light does this place him ! '' ","i":90406},{"w":"`` He is certainly a good brother , '' ","i":90529},{"w":"`` delightful , '' ","i":92449},{"w":"`` charming , '' ","i":92454},{"w":"`` Why is he so altered ? From what can it proceed ? It can not be for _ me _ -- it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . It is impossible that he should still love me . '' ","i":92865},{"w":"`` Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . '' ","i":93852},{"w":"`` I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' _ She _ a beauty ! -- I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . '' ","i":98695},{"w":"`` Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? '' ","i":100301},{"w":"`` Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . '' ","i":100592},{"w":"`` Do you really think so ? '' ","i":102643},{"w":"`` It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , '' ","i":103181},{"w":"`` that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half-year , nay , for a twelvemonth -- she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the -- shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it ? susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . '' ","i":103203},{"w":"`` I do indeed , '' ","i":103538},{"w":"`` But you -- how are you ? '' ","i":104499},{"w":"`` This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . '' ","i":105618},{"w":"`` Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ; that one false step involves her in endless ruin ; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ; and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . '' ","i":105672},{"w":"`` But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard . Give me further particulars . What did Colonel Forster say ? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? They must have seen them together for ever . '' ","i":105862},{"w":"`` Oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! '' ","i":106710},{"w":"`` Oh ! Jane , '' ","i":106828},{"w":"`` was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? '' ","i":106837},{"w":"`` She had better have stayed at home , '' ","i":107107},{"w":"`` perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one 's neighbours . Assistance is impossible ; condolence insufferable . Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . '' ","i":107120},{"w":"`` I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself . If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps , Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living , better than any other person . '' ","i":107996},{"w":"`` You must not be too severe upon yourself , '' ","i":109531},{"w":"`` I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . '' ","i":110061},{"w":"`` But perhaps you would like to read it . '' ","i":110389},{"w":"`` Is it possible ? '' ","i":110917},{"w":"`` And have you answered the letter ? '' ","i":110972},{"w":"`` No ; but it must be done soon . '' ","i":110984},{"w":"`` Oh ! my dear father , '' ","i":111011},{"w":"`` come back and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is in such a case . '' ","i":111022},{"w":"`` And may I ask -- '' ","i":111096},{"w":"`` but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . '' ","i":111106},{"w":"`` That is very true , '' ","i":111266},{"w":"`` though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh ! it must be my uncle 's doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . '' ","i":111276},{"w":"`` And they are really to be married !

The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! '' ","i":111606},{"w":"`` Their conduct has been such , '' ","i":111812},{"w":"`` as neither you , nor I , nor anybody can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it .

I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side-glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like anything . '' ","i":115939},{"w":"`` I thank you for my share of the favour , '' ","i":116453},{"w":"`` but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .

I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I _ should _ be looked at . I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people 's remarks .
